Today marked a first for me, my first experience usign Photoshop. When I opened the program, the first thought that ran through my head was, "Wow, there is a lot going on here." And yes, there was a lot going on, but after a few point and clicks around the page I slowly began to get a novice's grip on how things operate. Specifically, my mission was to intrdouce myself to the Typography contianed within Photoshop.

At first I chose a font and wrote somethign very simple, probaby along the lines of "This is some type." But then I found out there was more to just picking a font and a size. Oh there was so much more: colors, shapes, and 3D. 

And man oh man was there 3D. That is where the fun stared to pick up (again, after have to give myself a tutorial with a few more point and clicks around the page). I could pull the words apart, stretch them, give them shading, and rotate them on the page. The final "designs" I came up with were not very attractive. In fact they looked like the headers seen on a 90's high schooler's webpage. But creating them was fun, and most importantly planted the seed. That seed is one of fascination and eagerness, waiting to see what other, perhaps more professional, typographical designs I can create with Photoshop in the near future.
